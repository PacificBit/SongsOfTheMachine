# Songs Of The Machines

**Songs Of The Machines** is an Hytale mod created for the **first-ever Hytale ModJam**, where it was awarded **First Place**.

This project was developed under tight time constraints, with experimentation and creativity as the main focus.  
As such, the current version should be considered a **ModJam prototype**, not a production-ready mod.

## Why the source code is public

I decided to release the full source code to **give something back to the community**.

Hytale modding currently involves a lot of:
- reverse engineering
- code reading
- experimentation
- trial and error

By making this repository public, I hope it can be useful for:
- studying how certain systems are implemented
- understanding patterns and workarounds
- learning from both the *good* and the *bad* parts of the code

This code is shared primarily for **educational purposes**.

## Project status

⚠️ **Important**  
This version of Songs Of The Machines:
- was written quickly for a ModJam
- prioritizes ideas over polish
- may contain bugs, hacks, and unfinished systems
- does **not** represent the final architecture of the mod

I am currently working on a **full rewrite (v2)** with a cleaner design and improved structure.  
That version will live in a separate project and may use a different license.

## Support & questions

If you have questions about the code, ideas, or need help understanding specific parts:
- feel free to open an issue
- or ask directly

I’ll do my best to help when I can, but please keep in mind this is a **side project**.
